    Standard Unix Notes has now been reimplemented as a Python library 
    enabling new CLIs and GUIs to be built.
features:
- The functionality of Standard Unix Notes has now been reimplemented as 
  a python library allowing easy implementation of new CLI or GUI
  interfaces.
upgrade: 
- For users of standard-unix-notes the pynoteslib module uses TOML for
  it's configuration file. The filename remains the same but strings 
  should be enclosed in quotes. The usegit parameter is now a bool (True 
  or False) and therefore does not need quotes.
